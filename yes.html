      <h2>
        HEHEHEHHE kahibaw ko yeyy lovee youu so much mahal. Every moment without
        you feels like an eternity. I ache for your touch, your laughter, and
        the warmth of your presence. Each day, I find myself counting down the
        moments until I can hold you close again, until I can look into your
        eyes and tell you just how much you mean to me. You are my light in the
        darkness, my anchor in the storm, and I miss you more than words can
        express. Being apart from you has only made me realize how deeply I love
        you. Your kindness, your strength, your love they fill my heart with joy
        and longing. I carry our memories with me like precious treasures, and
        they sustain me until the day we can be together once more. Until then,
        please know that you are always in my thoughts and in my heart. ðŸ˜˜
