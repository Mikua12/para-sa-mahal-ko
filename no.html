      <h3>
        No Jokes! How Much Feelings You will eat ðŸ˜­. Though the distance between
        us weighs heavy on my heart, I want you to know that I cherish every
        moment we've shared, even if your feelings may not match mine. Your
        presence in my life has brought me immense joy and taught me valuable
        lessons about love and resilience. While I may long for more, I am
        grateful for the memories we've created and the moments we've shared.
        You will always hold a special place in my heart, and I wish you nothing
        but happiness and fulfillment in your journey.
